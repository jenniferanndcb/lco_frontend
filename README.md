## Description 

A simple web application that helps users browse, compare and analyse the prevalence of childhood obesity in London.

A user can choose as many London Boroughs and remove them by clicking the corresponding button. 

An interactive Eating Well guide has also been included to help users understand healthy eating. 

## Possible Future Changes or Upgrades 

* Additional data for each Borough to illustrate further inequalities particularly in areas where there are high levels of deprivation
* Include other guides to help user make better choices (e.g. healthy recipes for children, exercises, greenspace or park finder)

## Technologies Used 

Rails as an API for the server-side. React.js, Redux and Charts.js for the client-side.
