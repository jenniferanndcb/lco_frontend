        <p>
          Obesity is a complex public health challenge driven by a mixture of
          the social, economic, biological and environmental factors that shape
          our lives and individual behaviours. These drivers have become woven
          into the fabric of how we live our lives. This page aims to bring more
          understanding of the picture of childhood obesity in London as well as
          to feature London-wide initiatives to address this problem.
