        <h1>Childhood Obesity in London</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="infotext">
        <p>
          Obesity is a complex public health challenge driven by a mixture of
          the social, economic, biological and environmental factors that shape
          our lives and individual behaviours. These drivers have become woven
          into the fabric of how we live our lives. This page aims to bring more
          understanding of the picture of childhood obesity in London as well as
          to feature London-wide initiatives to address this problem.

        <h4>The impact of unhealthy weight</h4>
        <p>
          The evidence shows that being affected by unhealthy weight in childhood damages children's health both now and in the future. Unhealthy weight in childhood can lead to: 
          <ul>
            <li>early onset of chronic conditions e.g. type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers</li>
            <li>a high risk of unhealthy weight in adulthood with a greater risk of physical morbidity, disability and premature death</li>
            <li>poor psychological and emotional health including anxiety and depression, low self-esteem and higher likelihood of experiencing bullying and stigma</li>
            <li>tooth decay</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
